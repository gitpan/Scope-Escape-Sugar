NAME

Scope::Escape::Sugar - whizzy syntax for non-local control transfer

DESCRIPTION

This module provides specialised syntax for non-local control transfer
(jumping between stack frames), mainly based on the operators in
Common Lisp.  The non-local control transfers behave exactly like those
of Scope::Escape, which should be consulted for the semantic details.
This module provides more structured facilities, which take a variety
of approaches to referencing the stack frame to be transferred to.

All the keywords and functions exported by this module are lexically
scoped in the importing code.  That is, they are available from the
point of importation up to the end of the enclosing block.  This is
in contrast to the more common arrangement where exports are tied to a
package without regard for lexical boundaries.

NAME

Scope::Escape::Sugar - whizzy syntax for non-local control transfer

DESCRIPTION

This module provides specialised syntax for non-local control transfer
(jumping between stack frames), mainly based on the operators in
Common Lisp.  The non-local control transfers behave exactly like those
of Scope::Escape, which should be consulted for the semantic details.
This module provides more structured facilities, which take a variety
of approaches to referencing the stack frame to be transferred to.
